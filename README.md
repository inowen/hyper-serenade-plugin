# hyper-serenade-plugin
Plugin for the hyper terminal emulator 
I decided to make this from scratch for fun and because the official plugin crashes too often, because of some code it uses which doesn't seem to be uploaded in the same repository.

Also to add some useful functionality like always showing the output of ls, so that the user doesn't have to strain their voice saying it all the time, to add a history command (to execute a previous command again), and at some point I might add commands for auto-completion, to split the screen, etc.
